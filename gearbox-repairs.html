        <p>Over time, you may start to notice several issues with your clutch or gearbox. These issues can arise suddenly as a result of not shifting properly or through wear and tear on the gearbox.</p>
                
        <h2 class="full-article-sub-header">Some Common Faults</h2>         
                
        <ul class="full-article-ul">
            <li class="full-article-li">Hard Shifting – This incudes gearing up or down aggressively which over time will grind the gears themselves.</li> 
            
            <li class="full-article-li">Gear Noise – If you are hearing noise coming from the gearbox as you are changing gears, then you have an issue within the gearbox.</li> 
            
            <li class="full-article-li">Gear Slippage – When you are shifting gears and you fall out of gear from time to time then the gears could be damaged or rounded.</li> 
            
            <li class="full-article-li">Hard Clutch – Riding the clutch or not shifting properly will lead to transmission problems and worn out clutches.</li> 
                </ul>          
                
        <p>It is important that you are constantly mindful of these issues and do something to fix them as soon as you can. If left unattended, these issues could lead to large scale engine issues or the transmission needing to be replaced.</p>  
                
        <p>Remember: we are specialists in diagnostics and have the latest vehicle diagnostic equipment and software. Therefore, we are able to quickly determine the fault with your gearbox and resolve this rapidly!</p>
