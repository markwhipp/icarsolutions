        <p>At Ingenious Car Solutions, we are dedicated to offering a wide range of services and options to not only keep you and your vehicle on the road, but to maintain a sterling level of service. Our goal is to provide you with a dealership service at your doorstep! We achieve this by providing a very high standard, combined with a professional service and value for money. Our workshop is based in Wickford but we also have fully qualified mobile technicians, who can undertake both servicing and the majority of repairs at a place convenient for you.</p>
            
        <p>Professional and reliable vehicle servicing is important to us and we believe in completing your repair 'right first time'. We are able to achieve this, as our qualified and licensed technicians are of the highest quality and have the training and latest equipment necessary to conduct any level of repairs on your vehicle; from changing brake pads and servicing, to ECU remapping or even engine rebuilds.</p>    
                
        <p>We also believe in being transparent and honest with our customers and are not in the business of surprising our customers with work that was not discussed or adding “extras” once we have you in the workshop. If we carry out a service or repair and additional work is required, we will first send you a video showing you why this work is required and then we call you to discuss this in detail, so that you have full visibility and confidence knowing that you are dealing with professionals every step of the way.</p>     
                
        <p>Here at Ingenious Car Solutions, we offer a wide range of service packages designed to meet every need for your vehicle. Our mobile technicians and support staff would be happy to help guide you through what packages are available and help tailor match a level of servicing to your individual requirement i.e. from lubrication to Major services, we have a solution that will be sure to work for you.</p>  
                
        <p>Remember: our qualified and licensed mobile technicians are of the highest quality and have the training and latest equipment necessary to conduct any level of repairs on your vehicle!</p>
